# shell_funcs

### Rundown

Some helpful shell commands -- and templates for writing boilerplate for those commands -- that I've gathered and written.

Do not use these in production unless you know full well what the code is doing, as well as what **you're** doing. 

### Contents

- **git-fork-upstream**: Command for quickly adding a forked git repo as a remote for a local git repo.
- **kubelogs**: Handy little wrapper around the `kubectl logs` command.
